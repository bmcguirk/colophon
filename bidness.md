- [Toggl](http://www.toggl.com) - What are you working on?
- Freemind - Mind mapping. Great for braindumping/organizing thoughts pre-writing.
- ~~Hackpad~~ [Dropbox Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/paper) - I admit, I haven't used this much at work yet, but it's pretty compelling. Hackpad on steroids, really.
